# InDesign-Read-Only
I work off a network drive and needed something to warn me when the InDesign file opens as "Read-Only", which happens quite often. So this startup script pops up a warning if the InDesign file opens as "Read-Only."

**Note:** This script goes in InDesign's **Scripts/Startup Scripts** folder (which you may have to create if it doesnt already exist) and not the **Scripts/Scripts Panel** folder to run properly.
